Install
=======

The package requires a >=Python 3.6 installation. I recommend using pip and the pre-packaged PyPi release, which will automatically resolve dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pendsim

.. note::
    It may be useful to create an empty virtual environment so that installation of this package does not interfere with system dependencies. For more information, see the `Python guide to virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.


Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can manually install pendsim directly through the git repository:

.. code:: bash 

    git clone https://github.com/rland93/pendsim.git
    cd pendulum
    pip install -r requirements.txt
